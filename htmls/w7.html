                    <p>
                        Have you ever found yourself wondering about how to flirt with a girl over text? Sure, you know that texting is one of the most common and popular tools for communication now. However, it’s an entirely different ballgame from when you’re just conversing with a woman in person. There are just different dynamics there, and it’s not going to be the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might even be flustered at the idea of having to flirt with someone through text. That’s okay. There are just some guys out there who are better at flirting in person than they are through text messages. With that, you have to adjust.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Here are a few ways in which you can flirt with a girl over text:
                    </h4>
                    <h4>
                        1. Do a Callback Text
                    </h4>
                    <img src="../images/call.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        If you’re wondering about how to initiate a conversation with her through text, then you can always resort to a callback. So, think back to a conversation that the two of you had when you were talking in person. Maybe, you ended up talking about some movie that the two of you like. When you text her, send her a link or article about that movie so that you can pick up the conversation right where you left off.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        2. Incorporate Humor into Your Conversations
                    </h4>
                    <img src="../images/2-3.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Girls are always going to love a guy with a good sense of humor. So, whenever possible, try to inject a lot of humor into the way that you converse with her. Also, if the two of you have a compatible sense of humor, then that’s a good sign for your potential relationship. It’s always good when the two of you can laugh at and about the same things.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        3. Be Innocently Romantic
                    </h4>
                    <img src="../images/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Of course, you’re flirting with her. Naturally, you want to inject a bit of romance into the way that you communicate with her as well. However, if you’re just starting and getting to know each other, then you might want to take it easy. Don’t be so overt. But don’t hold back too much either. She has to know that you’re seriously interested in her.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        4. Throw a Few Compliments Her Way
                    </h4>
                    <img src="../images/throw.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Don’t be afraid of throwing a few compliments her way now and then. After all, you don’t exactly want to be keeping it a secret that you like her. Also, it’s going to show her that you’re paying attention to her personality and that you’re genuinely interested.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        5. Discuss Her Past Achievements
                    </h4>
                    <img src="../images/acheve.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        One great way to get her to start talking about herself is when you ask her about what she’s achieved in her life. Of course, this might require a little bit of digging and fishing on your part. But it’s always nice when a girl feels like you’re genuinely interested in what her life has been like for her. She’s also going to love opening about things that she’s proud of.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        6. Ask About Her Interests
                    </h4>
                    <img src="../images/flirt.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        One of the best ways to get her to be the one to carry a conversation is when you ask her about her interests. Try talking to her about her hobbies or ask her questions about what her job is like. This way, you are initiating the conversation, but she’s the one who is pushing it forward. Also, make sure that you’re asking the right questions here and that you’re responding accordingly.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        7. Talk About What Your Day is Like
                    </h4>
                    <img src="../images/like.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Don’t be afraid to just talk about what your day is like. You don’t always have to be discussing the deep and personal stuff. You can also just ramble on about random things that happen during your day. This is an excellent way of keeping things light and casual with your conversations.

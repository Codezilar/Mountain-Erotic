                    Society has a long history of prescribing how and when women should approach love. 
                    Each time they wake up, they’re reminded of their biological clock. Women are made
                    to feel worthless if they are not romantically associated with a man. In society,
                    women are advised on the type of husband, lifestyle, and career they should pursue.
                    Damn, it’s brutal out here, as they say.                    
                    Even so, despite all the collective agonies and resentments, a few women defy the 
                    judgment with their strength. Gwen Stefani would certainly qualify. In recent years,
                    she has cemented her legacy as one of the boldest, coolest women in pop culture by
                    pursuing love at 50. <br>                    
                    On July 3, 2021, No Doubt’s frontwoman marries country singer Blake Shelton. In her
                    midlife milestone, we can learn the following:
                </p>
                <h4>After finding out about her <br>
                    husband’s infidelity, Gwen <br>
                    thought her “dreams were shattered”</h4>
                <p>
                    Gwen Stefani met Gavin Rossdale in 1995 during a holiday concert for radio station KROQ  
                    with No Doubt and Bush. The couple married in 2002 at St. Paul’s Church, London, and
                    welcomed three children: Kingston, Zuma, and Apollo. It had been a happy marriage, but
                    it turned sour on Gavin’s end. 
                    It was 2015 when Gavin’s infidelities became public, including a three-year affair with
                    the family nanny. Gavin allegedly had sex with his nanny after Apollo was born in 2014,
                    whereas other papers claim he used to bring Mindy along on tour while his kids dazed off
                    next to her while she had sex. There’s no way to prove the truth behind every sordid 
                    report, but there’s reliable proof Gavin cheated on his wife of thirteen years.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/a1.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    The marriage ended when Gavin’s affair with the nanny was confirmed – a classic 
                    Hollywood scandal. For Gwen, the whole thing was a nasty, tacky embarrassment; 
                    she shielded for cover as the mainstream media picked apart her husband and put
                    every aspect of her life under the microscope. <br>
                    Gwen told a heartbreaking story about her ordeal in an interview with Glamour.
                    Hell was just getting started. She said she would have told everyone, but she
                    had to keep her mouth shut for the sake of her kids. During her rapidly imploding
                    marriage, the singer went back to work and quietly dealt with it.
                    
                    It’s the most harrowing moment that shows your true strength. She did what she
                    always does in tough situations: she prayed. She couldn’t let Gavin’s disgusting
                    behavior consume her; she had to look out for her boys and stand up for herself.                    
                    Cheating is, unfortunately, one of the most mundane things in life. If you’ve made
                    it this far without encountering it in any form – as the aggressor or the victim – you’re
                    one of the lucky ones. It might seem like a simple thing, but it has lasting effects on
                    the people involved. If you’re a victim, it can wreak havoc on your self-esteem and confidence.                  
                </p>

                    sometimes you get disillusioned about love, and you’ll find that it’s hard to put your faith 
                    in anyone and really rely on them to fulfill you in any way, shape, or form. Gwen’s not just 
                    brave for bearing the torture under the spotlight; she opened her heart to someone new in a
                     matter of months. It worked out great
                </p>
                <h4>The beginning of Gwen and Blake’s relationship was fraught with trust issues</h4>
                <p>
                    Gwen and Blake met on The Voice in November 2015. A close, co-working partnership ended up 
                    blossoming into a love story that changed both of their lives. Interestingly, both Gwen and
                    Blake were going through the same thing at the same time, so they were able to connect over
                    their heartaches without beating around the bush.
                    In her story, Gwen describes how they both struggled with trust issues in the first few weeks,
                    but they were able to get over them with empathy and communication. It was a “miracle” to find 
                    ove so soon after “months and months of torture.”      
                    Besides, dating in your late forties and fifties carries an unattractive stigma, as if women of
                    a certain age are suddenly unattractive and thus unworthy of love. We either get the impression
                    that they’re malicious cougars looking to relive their youth or sad, lonely women who just can’t
                    seem to get any luck. Gwen and Blake’s relationship is proof that love doesn’t expire and it
                    doesn’t matter how many bad breaks you’ve been through, as long as you’re in a position to 
                    find happiness. We shouldn’t be concerned about whether older women are desirable – they are, 
                    as long as they feel like it.
                </p>

                <h4>Love accepts everything</h4>
                <p>
                    Pay no attention to what other people say – love doesn’t care about your age, your background, 
                    your job, your status, or anything else. People who have experienced love at its fullest 
                    understand you can find and keep love at any age. Just let it consume you on its own terms, and 
                    your heart will follow. In fact, our life experiences make us more capable of accepting and 
                    savoring love as we age.
                    Considering Gwen overcome her traumas at 50 to build a future with Blake, you have nothing to 
                    stop you from finding your true love. Society is made of manufactured pressures, but love isn’t.

                    It’s an unfortunate thing whenever one person in a marriage happens to fall out of love with the other.

                    It’s an unfortunate thing whenever one person in a marriage happens to fall out of love with the other. However, it’s also something that happens way more often than we’d like. And the fact remains that it keeps on happening to a lot of couples. But something that not a lot of individuals realize is that just because someone falls out of love in a relationship doesn’t mean that the marriage is doomed. You can always save a marriage so as long as the two of you show a willingness to work hard for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem here is that not a lot of men realize that their wives have fallen out of love with them. And whenever that’s the case, the relationship just slowly fades in the night like a dying light. After all, the first step to solving a problem recognizes that there is one. This is why you always need to stay mindful of the way that your relationship is running. If you have no idea how your wife feels about you, then you have no business being in that relationship in the first place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you notice that a lot of the signs listed here apply to your wife, then you might have cause for worry. You need to make an immediate adjustment if you want things to change. Here are a few signs that your wife has fallen out of love with you.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/couple-sad.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Of course, the moment she stops letting you in, you should be concerned. After all, the whole point of being in a relationship is having someone with whom you can share everything. And if she stops sharing altogether, then that’s a significant cause for concern on your part.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    2. She is continuously irritable around you.
                </h4>
                <img src="../images/saddd.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Ultimately, you would ideally want to be generating positive vibrations in your relationship as much as possible. However, this isn’t always going to be the case for a lot of couples. If you notice that she’s just always irritated by the things that you do, that could be a sign that she has some contempt directed towards you.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    3. She doesn’t engage in physical intimacy.
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Remember that the one thing that separates lovers from two people who are just really close friends is physical intimacy. That means that if the two of you aren’t being physically intimate with one another, then you’ve virtually eliminated the one defining factor that makes you a romantic couple. You need to be able to fix that.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    4. She stops paying attention to you.
                </h4>
                <p>
                    You always have to be paying attention to one another in a relationship. After all, communication is going to be one of the most important aspects of making a relationship work. So, if your partner has permanently shut you off, then you know that something is wrong. A girl who loves you would always be willing to hear you out and listen to what you have to say.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    5. She ceases catering to your needs.
                </h4>
                <img src="../images/sadpeep.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    You always have to make it a point to cater to each other’s needs. You must always have each other’s backs. That’s why it’s still going to be a red flag if she stops catering to your needs altogether. After all, you should always be working as a team to make each other’s lives easier. The moment you stop doing so is the day your love dies.

                    Who says that girls aren’t fit to use pickup lines? It’s okay for you to want to find out 
                    some sweet pick up lines for him. There are all sorts of romantic pick up lines for guys 
                    out there. And you shouldn’t be afraid to use them.
                    These days, girls are gaining more and more traction when it comes to societal privileges. 
                    Sure, it’s always been a patriarchal society since the start. However, society is gradually 
                    leveling the playing field in a variety of areas when it comes to gender equality. Women 
                    these days are in much better positions to succeed as compared to the past. It’s evident 
                    in a lot of industries all over the world. In politics, business, science, and sports, 
                    women are beginning to dominate.                    
                    So, in the dating scene, it shouldn’t be any different, right? Women should have just as 
                    much right to make the first move in dating as men do. A lot of backward-minded people 
                    still seem to think that men should always be the ones to make the first move. However, 
                    that would be a big mistake. More and more men these days seem to like it when women go 
                    after what they want. So, if you’re a woman who’s reading this, don’t be ashamed about 
                    wanting to pursue guys. It’s good that you’re showing that initiative. You shouldn’t have 
                    to feel bad about wanting to make that first move.                    
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Using Pickup Lines to Flirt <br> with Him
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Pickup lines are a lot of fun. They’re a great way of showing the fun and jovial side of 
                    your personality.
                    When you make use of a pickup line to flirt with someone, you are automatically showing 
                    them that you have
                    a great sense of humor. On top of that, you get a chance to showcase your sense of humor 
                    as well. However,
                    not everyone is always going to be gifted with the wit and creativity to create pickup
                    lines for themselves. This is precisely where an article like this comes in handy. You 
                    are free to use any of the lines listed here. Make them your own and see the guys swoon over 
                    your charisma and charm. There’s nothing wrong with borrowing words from another person. 
                    There’s nothing new under the sun anymore at this point. This is especially true when you’re 
                    thinking of lines to express your attraction. So, now that you’re ready, here are some of 
                    the best pickup lines out there that you could use on him.

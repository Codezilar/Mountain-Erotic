                        If you’re not going to choose her, then you might as well leave her. You should never be treating her as if she’s only going to be relegated to second place. This is a woman who is deserving of much better than that. Don’t be chasing after her if you know in your heart that she isn’t the girl who you want to be with. It’s essential that she doesn’t end up as one of the girls you play around with. That would be wrong. If you have some emotional baggage in your life, you shouldn’t be taking it out on her. Resolve your issues and try to leave her out of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After all, what she wants to do is to love you. However, if you’re going to continue to treat her this way, then she isn’t going to respond too well. If she isn’t going to end up as your first choice, then stop making it seem as if it’s like that. Don’t get her to become all vulnerable only for you to leave her hanging high and dry. Additionally, stop chasing after her if you’re only going to dump her once you have her as putty in your hands. No one wants to be mistreated in such a manner. And she certainly doesn’t deserve it.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Take Care of Her Heart
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        She wants to love you with all of her heart. However, she’s afraid to do so because she knows that she’s putting herself at risk. That’s why you should be doing everything in your power to assure her that you would never hurt her. And she is never going to get that from you if you keep on putting her in second place. After all, no one likes being a mere option. Everyone always wants to be a priority. Everyone wants to be the most important. If you don’t plan on sticking around long enough for her, then you shouldn’t be there for her at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let her down easily. Break things off. After all, you know that this is the right thing to do. She wants to feel loved. However, she isn’t going to be able to receive the love that she deserves from you. That’s why it’s essential for you to be honest right at the start. Don’t try to get her hopes up. Stop making it seem like there’s a chance for you to be that guy for her. She’s going to buy into whatever you tell her. That’s why you always have to be responsible for what you say.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Stop Being All Sweet Only to Abandon Her
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        If you don’t plan on sticking around for too long, then stop being sweet with her. Don’t look into her eyes for hours on end only to have your mind wandering. Granted, you are allowed to have your own life. You are always encouraged to pursue your personal goals and interests. However, if you want to find true love, then you still need to make space for that special someone. And if she isn’t that particular person to you, then stop treating her as if she is. You never want to be acting intelligently or sneakily when it comes to love and romance. Be fair to her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After all, it isn’t fair that you lead her on with no hope at all. It’s not fair that you make her feel like she has to wait for you a little longer. Undoubtedly, it would be fantastic if she would be able to change your mind about it. But you know that that just isn’t going to be happening at all. That’s why you should only be letting her down easy. You should be upfront by telling her that things are never going to work out. Don’t give her false hope. After all, these false lifelines can be very dangerous to a person’s psyche.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Don’t Be Selfish and Let Her Go
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Admittedly, it feels nice to have someone like her around to feed into your ego. Undoubtedly, it feels great to know that you have someone who would give up her own life for you. However, you can’t be that cruel. She is a human being with her fair share of emotions and feelings too. You have to be able to acknowledge that you treat her terribly by not choosing to be with her every day that you’re together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Make that choice. Be a man. Own up to whatever decision you make. Regardless if you end up choosing her or not, she will get closure. And that’s a lot better than just being led on day by day by a man she can’t ever be sure with.
                    </p>

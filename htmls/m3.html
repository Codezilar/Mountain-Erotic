Isn’t it a nice feeling to know that you’re top of mind first thing in the morning? Well, you can enforce that by making it a habit of sending your man sweetly crafted good morning texts.

                    2. Hello, my love! I hope that you have the best day today. <br>
                    3. There are two things that I need to do this morning: have some coffee and tell you that I love you. <br>
                    4. I’m not having the best morning because you’re not here beside me. But at least I know that I can be the first one you think of when you wake up. <br>
                    5. Best of mornings to you, my love. Regardless of how things are going to turn out today, know that my love is always there.    <br>
                    6. I just woke up from the most fantastic dream. But real life is much better because you’re here as well. <br>
                    7. I can say with absolute confidence that I would love nothing more than to wake up in your arms every single day for the rest of my life. <br>

                    11. Your smile is all the sunshine that I need to wake me up in the morning. <br>
                    12. Hi! I just wanted to take the time this morning to check up on the most handsome guy in the world. <br>
                    13. Before you start your workday, allow me this opportunity to let you know that I love you. <br>

                    15. Good morning! If you have some time, come over for breakfast. I have something extra special in mind for you. <br>
                    16. They say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. But I still think that nothing beats having you as a snack. Good morning! <br>
                    17. I’m going to send over some virtual good morning kisses for you now. That’s all I have. I’ll just save the best for later. <br>
                    18. To be honest, I spent the whole night just dreaming of you. I’m going to spend the rest of the day with you running through my mind. <br>
                    19. I’ve got nothing creative or mind-blowing to text you this morning. All I can say is that I love you. And I hope that’s enough. <br>
                    20. Even just the thought of you is enough to bring me a lot of joy and happiness this morning. <br>
                    21. I may not be waking up with you this morning. But I’m happy knowing that I’ll be seeing you before the day is done. <br>
                    22. Good morning to the one and only man who makes me feel happy like no other. <br>
                    23. Good morning, my love! Every day, you steal my heart, and I never want to ask for it back. <br>
                    24. Is it weird that I went to sleep last night just thinking about how excited I was to text you this morning? That’s the effect you have on me. <br>

                <p>
                    There you have it. Never underestimate the value of text message communications in a relationship. You must utilize whatever tool you have at your advantage to make sure that your partner always knows how valuable he is to you. A real relationship is always built on healthy and proper communication between two adults. This is the best way to generate intimacy between the two of you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Intimacy is the level of closeness that you have with one another in your relationship. The closer you are, then the stronger you become as a couple. You might not think much of a text message. But it carries hefty weight in determining the strength of your relationship. So, don’t belittle the value of composing a well-placed good morning message. This can go a very long way in bringing the two of you closer together as a couple.

                    Have you ever found yourself in a position of having feelings for a guy but not knowing if he feels the same way? You try to get creative and think of ways on how to make a guy confess his feelings. And yet, you’re stumped. After all, men are very complex emotional creatures. They are rarely ever in touch with their emotions. As a result, it can be very frustrating on your part. You want to know if he feels the same way, but you have no way of knowing.

                    Through the practice of trial and error, specific trends have emerged in relationships. From this, women have been able to gather some of the best practices in getting men to open up about their feelings. If you want, you are free to use some of these tips and tricks yourself. Of course, they aren’t necessarily guaranteeing that he’s going to open up. However, it’s going to put you in a much better position to get him to confess his feelings. Some men just require time. You just have to stay as patient as you can be.
                </p>       
                
                <h4>It Can Get Tricky</h4>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, you can have a pretty good idea of whether a guy is really into you or not. Sometimes, you might not even have any clue at all. Of course, if you’re pretty sure of yourself, you can just straight up ask him whether he likes you or not. This technique might work for a specific group of men who respond to straightforwardness. However, there’s nothing wrong with you wanting to take a more subtle approach to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If being straightforward isn’t your style, then that’s fine. There are other tricks that you can pull out of your bag here. Just make sure that the techniques you practice are natural and unforced. Otherwise, you risk screwing it up and driving him away instead of getting him to open up. Anyway, love is always a risk. And if he’s worth that risk, it shouldn’t be a problem.

                    It’s About Getting Him to Be More Vulnerable
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Ultimately, the key to getting him to open up to you is to induce a sense of vulnerability out of him. You have to get him to feel comfortable with opening up to you on an emotional level. Of course, this is a lot easier said than done. There are many layers to a man’s emotional makeup. However, if you are persistent enough, you can gradually break down his walls in a systematic manner. It’s just a matter of doing things every day to try to get him to put his guards down.
                    Now, with all of that information out of the way, let’s get right to tips. Here are some of the things that you can do to get your guy to open up to you about how he feels.

                <h4>
                    Six Simple Steps on How To Make A Guy Confess His Feelings:
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    1. Respond to His Body Language
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Pay very close attention to his body language. Without him realizing it, he’s telling you how he feels with how he’s acting. If his body language is continuously positioned in a way that is inviting and approachable towards you, then that’s a good sign. That might be all you need to work with.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    2. Express Your Gratitude
                </h4>
                <p>
                    One great way of getting him to lower his guard is to express your gratitude. You always want him to feel as if you are appreciative of the things that he does for you. This way, it makes him feel good about himself as well.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    3. Have Fun with One Another
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Always try to find ways to have fun with one another. This way, he’s going to start associating the idea of fun with being with you. When this happens, he’s going to grow more and more comfortable towards you. And with that comfort, he’s going to develop a sense of vulnerability as well.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    4. Express Your Interest in Things He Cares About
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Another great way of getting him to be more comfortable around you is to express interest in the things he’s interested in. It’s so easy to get a guy to open up about things that he’s passionate about. Use that to your advantage.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    5. Don’t Let Your Assumptions Get the Best Of You
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Sure, it’s okay for you to hope that he has certain feelings for you. However, it’s crucial that you not let these hopes turn into assumptions. You don’t want to come out looking as if you’re very stuck up and self-obsessed.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    6. Just Be Direct
                </h4>
                <p>
                    You can only wait for so long. If it gets to the point wherein you can’t wait any longer, just be direct with him. Ask him if he likes you or has feelings for you. The worst-case scenario is that he doesn’t. If that’s the case, then at least you will know not to waste your time with this guy anymore.
                </p>

                        Sometimes, a breakup isn’t necessarily the automatic end of a relationship. Just because two people break up doesn’t mean that they lose their feelings for one another. That’s not the way that breakups work. It also gets to a point wherein people will accept that the breakup took place even though they’re still in love. Now, since that’s very common, it’s quite possible that some of your exes still haven’t let go of the feelings that they had for you when you were in a relationship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s not a rare occurrence either. In fact, many couples end their relationships without wanting to. Have you ever wondered whether your ex was still waiting for you or not? Well, that’s okay. You’re not alone there. Maybe you’ve already been thinking about getting back together in a relationship with them, but you haven’t been sure if they feel the same way. Fortunately for you, there are a few signals that you can keep an eye out for to know if your ex is still waiting for you.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Five reasons why your ex is still waiting for you.
                    </h4>
                    <h4>
                        1. They try to talk to you all the time.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        They enjoy your company and conversation so much. This is why they try to talk to you as much as possible. They are also secretly hoping that you would realize the same thing about them.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        2. They make you feel nostalgic about the past.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Nostalgia is a potent tool, and they know this. This is precisely why they will make an effort to make you feel nostalgic about your past. Once they can arouse that nostalgia out of you, they know that they have a good chance of getting you to like them again.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        3. They ask you about your current relationship status.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Obviously, they are trying to see if they have a shot at getting back with you again. They know that they have higher chances of getting back with you if you’re single and aren’t involved with anyone else. They are essentially sizing you up by asking you this question.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        4. They make an effort to hang out with you.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Besides just talking to you a lot, they will try to make a serious effort to hang out with you as often as possible. They want to spend time with you because they enjoy your company.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        5. They ask you if you’re willing to get back together.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, some exes will outright ask you if you’re interested in getting back together with them. They won’t hide their feelings for you.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Conclusion
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Sure, at the end of the day, it’s always nice to know that someone is in love with you. However, that love isn’t always going to be enough to sustain a relationship. You still have to decide whether the two of you ultimately have what it takes to make a relationship work in the future. Keep in mind that you’ve already tried and failed in the past. If you’re going to try again in the future, then things must be different.
                    </p>

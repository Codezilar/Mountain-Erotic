                        As you make your way through life, you are going to encounter a lot of different kinds of people. There are going to be some individuals who will cause you pain and make you cry. You’re going to meet people who will make you so happy that you would be smiling from ear to ear whenever the two of you are together. There are going to be sure people who will make you laugh until your insides split. But even though you meet so many different kinds of people, you would rarely find someone who truly understands you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As human beings, we all have this innate feeling to be accepted and desired by the people around us. We always want to be loved and adored. It’s as if we have this natural desire just to gain the good favor of the people we meet every day. But on a more fundamental level, we are always looking to be understood. We still want to make sure that people get why we exist and why we do what we do. Somehow, feeling understood almost feels like your existence is being validated. And feeling appreciated is a huge aspect of being loved by someone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of the people that you’re going to encounter in your everyday life aren’t going to understand just what it is you’re looking for. A lot of the individuals that you consistently interact with aren’t going to get what you want out of life and what inspires you. Very few people are going to truly empathize with you whenever you’re going through the struggles and trials that you go through. The person who best understands you is going to be yourself. And it can feel lonely and overwhelming for a lot of people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make matters worse, a lot of people that you’re going to meet might even tell you that certain aspects of your life need to change. A lot of people are going to make you feel bad for liking a particular thing or being a certain way. You’re going to encounter plenty of individuals who will criticize and make fun of you. There are plenty of people who are looking to bring you down even though you only have the best and purest intentions. That’s just a fact of life. In your world wherein you are the protagonist, you are going to have specific antagonists who will look to contradict your every move.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And sometimes, it can get exhausting having to deal with these people. You know that you can’t just act on your own accord without regard for those around you. You understand that you have an individual responsibility to society. For you to be a functional member of the world, you need to adhere to certain social norms and expectations. That’s why you long for acceptance. You want to be liked because you think that the more people who are on your side, the better. You don’t want to be looking back on your life and see what you’ve been alone every step of the way. However, it can also be tiring having to subject yourself to the standards and expectations of other people.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is where falling in love comes in. Because once you find that one particular person who is going to be able to bring a sense of joy, happiness, fulfillment, and excitement into your life on a level that no one else can, it’s going to be different. Sure, you might be having a hard time having to subject yourself to the corrupt and negative energy of others. You might be feeling overwhelmed. But with the person you love, you should always feel welcome to be your true and authentic self.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, you are always made to feel like you can be your “weird” and “off-putting” self because you know that you are never going to be judged. In love, there is no judgment. In love, there is no harsh criticism. There is always going to be understanding and patience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you fall in love with someone, you don’t have to put on a mask. You don’t have to hide behind any curtains or facades. You aren’t afraid of being judged or being called weird. When you fall in love, you know that there is someone who is always going to make you feel accepted no matter what you do or what you say. When you have someone who loves you, it’s going to be like nothing else you could have ever imagined. It will be like having an extended version of yourself just giving you the affirmation and validation that you crave from everyone else. Somehow, being in love makes your existence feel more valid.

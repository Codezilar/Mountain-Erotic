                <h1>6 Ridiculous Break Up Phrases Men Use</h1>
                <p>Words are powerful. Break up phrases are catastrophic.</p>    
            </div>
        </div>
            <div class="wrapper">   
                <div class="div">
                    <p>
                        Breakups are tough. Some relationships are mature and end in a sophisticated way. While others are a little less mature, hence they end up breaking up in an immature manner. I do not recommend breaking up via text message; it’s very disrespectful to your partner. Have the courage to face your partner when you want to tell them why things can’t work out. You’re both adults; you can talk to each other and decide. It’s not impossible, and it certainly can’t be done over messages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s not easy breaking up, I’ll admit. But still, people should be civil when they’re breaking the “news.”
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Here are six of the most ridiculous break up phrases used by men.
                    </h4>
                    <h4>
                        1. “I’m Just Not Ready Yet.”
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        We are all very familiar with this line; it is only a guy beating around the bush because he can’t say, “I don’t want you anymore.” This line may come in the form of “it’s not you, it’s me,” “you’re special to me, but I need time,” “I can’t commit yet, but if I had to, you’d be the one.” It’s only a way for a guy to tell you he wants to sleep with other women and not get exclusive with just one girl. Find someone who cherishes you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        P.S. – This article is written by a guy.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        2. “We Can Still Be Friends.”
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        This line comes when the guy still wants you around but doesn’t want to commit to you. It happens when he’s unsure if he’ll find someone else and he needs you to be there as a backup when he fails, these words may sound harsh, but they’re the reality of how it is. Choose your self-respect and say no to being friends.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        3. “You Can Do So Much Better.”
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        These type of reverse psychology phrases are widespread among guys who are too scared to tell you they never loved you, and they’re tired of seeing you every day. But they’re right; you really can do so much better than them, better than a person who can’t even spell out their true feelings and doesn’t have the guts to say what they feel.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        4. “You Are Great & Beautiful, But…”
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The horrid “but” of destruction comes into play when the guy has met someone better looking than you, and he feels like he deserves to be with that person. It happens when the guy you’re with is so superficial that he gives priority to looks over feelings. You shouldn’t be sad, though, because you’re better off without that person. Beauty fades away, emotions live forever, and someone who can’t cherish your feelings doesn’t deserve to be with you.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        5. “I Have A Fear Of Commitment.”
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        This means that the guy is immature and not worth your time. Guys who fear commitment are the ones who want to try their luck with every possible girl they see, and they don’t want to be stuck with just one girl forever. You need to let them go, show them how immature they are, and find someone who isn’t afraid to hold your hand tightly and show the world.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        6. “I Need Some Time Off.”
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        It means the guy either found someone else or was hiding something from you and didn’t want you to know and insult him. Don’t get me wrong, taking time off is normal in certain situations where you two either go through a huge fight or when the guy wants to talk his feelings out, and he just wants to figure out how to, but In most cases, it just means they’re over you and they want you to drift away yourself.

                        Even though it might not really make a lot of sense for a mother who has only three kids to actually experience more stress than a mother who has four or more kids. But the science seems to indicate that this truly is the case. Naturally, when you have kids, you’re going to have to go through some very stressful stretches. From the moment the kid is born to the moment that that kid morphs into an adult – and even beyond that – a mother is always going to concern herself with her child’s welfare.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are a mom, you are always going to exert a lot of time and effort into making sure that your kid is going to grow up into a competent and able member of society. And you also want to make sure that you don’t expose them to dangerous situations that they wouldn’t be able to handle. But it’s not always going to be a hard time. Kids bring a lot of joy, meaning, happiness, lightness, and fulfillment into the lives of their mothers.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        If you can take care of three kids, you can do anything
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        In a survey that was carried out in 2013 by Today Parents, it showed that mothers with three children were more prone to getting higher levels of stress as compared to other moms. 7,164 moms based in the United States took part in the study. It was found out that mothers with three kids actually have to deal with the highest levels of stress. They rated the levels of the stress to be an 8.5 on a scale of 10.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        60% of mothers also confirmed that girls are more stressful to raise as compared to boys. The idea is that girls require a lot more care and attention as opposed to boys who require less supervision and guidance. Naturally, this is a very debatable topic and not all people are going to see this in the same way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Going from one to two was an easy, breezy transition,” explained Jill Smokler, one of the participants in the survey. “Two to three, everything was turned upside down. I did not feel like I had it together…just crossing the street and not being able to physically hold all their hands. I found this tremendously stressful.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A lot of people would make the argument that having four kids would be a lot more stressful experience than having to raise just three kids. And this might actually be true. However, according to the expertise of famed Psychiatrist Dr. Janet Taylor, the number 3 might actually serve as the breaking point for a vast majority of parents. After you have three kids, it’s going to be hard to find some time for peace. She says, “There’s just not enough space in your head for perfectionism when you get to four or more kids. The more children you have, the more confident you become in your parenting abilities. You have to let go … and then you’re just thankful when they all get to school on time.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Usually, moms who have four kids are practically masters at parenting and very few things stress them out.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Here are some other mother-related statistics:
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        72% of mothers are stressed about how stressed they are. <br>
                        60% of mothers say that they are mostly stressed about how little time they have to get things done. <br>
                        90% of moms are stressed about staying fit and attractive. <br>
                        46% of moms say that their husbands are more stressful than their kids.
                        All moms and dads who are wanting to have three or more kids are going to have to prepare for the absolute worst. As it is with anything else in life, preparation is always going to be key. And parenting isn’t going to be any different. You are going to be under a lot of pressure to do the right things and make the right choices when it comes to your parenting. But ultimately, a child is a blessing. And you always want to make sure that you do right by them.

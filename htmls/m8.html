              <p>
                Think back to all of the best and most amazing moments that you have shared with bae. It’s likely that the memories you will come up with are made up of the two of you being in each other’s presence. It’s very rare that the most amazing moments of your relationship are when the two of you are apart from one another. However, that doesn’t mean that just because the two of you can’t be in the same physical space, you shouldn’t be making an effort with him anymore.
              </p>
              <p>
                In fact, it’s the total opposite.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the two of you are apart, you still have an opportunity to be all kind and sweet towards your man. It’s all just a matter of you showing a certain willingness and a vulnerability whenever you text with him. Texting is something that a lot of women tend to overlook in a relationship. But it really is a very powerful tool in being able to bring the two of you closer together. You just might not know it yet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even though it can seem very impersonal just because you aren’t really talking to one another in person, you shouldn’t think of it that way. You are always going to want to communicate with your man using whatever platform you can get your hands on. Texting is a great platform for you to still be affectionate and intimate even though you might not be in the same room together.
              </p>
              <img src="../images/girl.jpg" alt="">
              <p>
                However, not many women have necessarily mastered the art of texting. In fact, there are some women who are completely clueless about it – and you might even be one of them. There are just certain texts that you might be sending your man which he secretly hates. And there might be certain messages that he wishes he could be receiving from you instead. If you need a little more guidance and mentoring on that front, then this is the article for you. Highlighted in this piece will be the texts that you should stop texting your man, and the messages that you should be sending him instead.
              </p>
              <h4>
                1. Stop texting: “What’s up?”
              </h4>
              <p>
                This is such a nonchalant and casual text message. It might seem like you’re not really interested in getting to know him or what he’s really up to.
              </p>
              <img src="../images/xup.jpg" alt="">
              <h4>
                Instead, text him: “Wish I was with you now!”
              </h4>
              <p>
                Instead of just asking him what’s up, actually, let him know that you wish you were with him at this moment! Let him know that you miss him and that you hate the fact that the two of you just happen to be apart from one another right now.
              </p>
              <img src="../images/shoot.png" alt="">
              <h4>
                2. Stop texting: “I don’t know. You decide.”
              </h4>
              <p>
                If he asks you about what you want to do for date night, then give him a straight answer. Stop leaving him to make all of the decisions. It might give him the impression that you’re disinterested.
              </p>
              <img src="../images/phone.jpg" alt="">
              <h4>
                Instead, text him: “I think we should try doing this tonight!”
              </h4>
              <p>
                Show initiative. Text him exactly what you want to do with him tonight. Be direct and let him know that you’re enthusiastic about the idea of being able to spend time with him.
              </p>
              <h4>
                3. Stop texting: “Why are you going out without me?”
              </h4>
              <p>
                Don’t make him feel bad for having a life. You should still be supportive of the fact that he has friends outside of the relationship. Don’t be overly clingy and territorial. That is never a good look to have in any kind of romantic relationship.
              </p>
              <img src="../images/sad.jpg" alt="">
              <h4>
                Instead, text him: “Let me know when you’re free to hang out next!”
              </h4>
              <p>
                Respect his time and his schedule. Ask him respectfully when he would be free to hang out with you. Don’t make it seem like you feel entitled to have all of his time.
              </p>
              <img src="../images/gur.jpg" alt="">
              <h4>
                4. Stop texting: “Did you pick up the laundry?”
              </h4>
              <h4>
                Instead, text him: “I appreciate everything that you do for me.”
              </h4>
              <p>
                Instead of texting him to do things for you all of the time, why don’t you try showing some gratitude and appreciation instead? Let him know that his efforts don’t go unnoticed or underappreciated. You have to show him that you understand his worth.
              </p>
              <img src="../images/dem.jpg" alt="">
              <h4>
                5. Stop texting: “Want to do it later?”
              </h4>
              <p>
                Not to say that you and your girl shouldn’t be having any sensual and romantic moments with one another. But it shouldn’t be something that you should constantly be initiating through text. You don’t want to give her the wrong idea of what your intentions might be.
              </p>
              <img src="../images/hola.jpg" alt="">
              <h4>
                Instead, text him: “I can’t wait to have you all to myself!”
              </h4>
              <p>
                Never get tired of letting him know that you love him. This is something that he is never going to grow tired of hearing. Take the time to text him that you love him every so often.
              </p>

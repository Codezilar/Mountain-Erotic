                </p>

                <h4>

                </h4>
                <img src="../images/struggle.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    The dating world is always going to be a struggle. It’s not easy when you’re inexperienced, and you’re just trying to stay afloat as you traverse the dating world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, that doesn’t mean that you have to do things entirely on your own. Countless people in history have fallen in love before. They have been around the block. So, you can always take any opportunities that you can learn from them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Naturally, it’s going to be a different situation for everyone. What may work for certain men isn’t necessarily going to work for others. Even though it might seem like finding success in dating is an impossible task, you shouldn’t be discouraged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many people have felt what you’re feeling now and have managed to find love anyway. You are going to be able to find love eventually. You just have to make sure that you’re putting yourself in the best position to do so.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Finding a Solution
                </h4>
                <img src="../images/finding.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Although, it’s still a reality that most people would struggle with dating and that there is a natural learning curve there. Not to worry. If you’re one of those people, then this is going to be the perfect article for you.     
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    There are specific tips and tricks that you can use for yourself to help you up to your dating game. Some of which are going to be highlighted right in this article. However, before we move on even further, you need to remember always to be yourself. That’s the most important thing.               
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Staying True to Who You Are
                </h4>

                <img src="../images/true.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    It’s true. There are all sorts of tips and tricks that you could try out for yourself when you’re flirting with guys that you like. Although, if you feel awkward doing so or if it feels unnatural to you, then it’s going to show.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And when that happens, your flirtatious advances are just going to backfire on you. Given that, always make it a point to stay true to who you are. So, without much further ado, here are a few things that you can do to up your flirting game.
                </p>
                 
                <h4>
                    Maintain Eye Contact with Him
                </h4>
                <img src="../images/eye.jpg" alt="">

                <p>
                    Eye contact is always going to be important when it comes to flirtation. For one, it lets him know that he has all of your focus and attention. Next, he’s going to be able to tell that you’re sincere when you’re interacting with him.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Keep in mind that the eyes are the windows to the soul. This is one of the most effective ways of really letting him know that you’re serious here.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Smile at Him Often
                </h4>

                <img src="../images/smile.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    You always want him to feel like he can be completely comfortable and at ease with you. This is why smiling at him often is always a good idea. On top of that, it’s going to make him feel like you’re inviting him into your world. There’s a certain warmth that a smile can bring, which nothing else in the world could ever replicate.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Touch Him Playfully
                </h4>
                <img src="../images/touch.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Now, be very careful with this one because it could either play well or it could ultimately backfire. There are certain guys out there who don’t really like being touched.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, for the most part, guys like a little flirtation via a few light touches. Just make sure that it doesn’t seem forced. Also, don’t be too aggressive or forward about it. Make sure that it’s playful but tasteful.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Give Him Compliments
                </h4>
                <img src="../images/complain.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Don’t be afraid to throw a few compliments his way every once in a while. This is a great way to make him feel more relaxed and comfortable with you. Also, it lets him know that you’re really paying attention to his personality and that you’re not just playing him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Men are always going to want honesty from the women they’re just getting to know. If you lie to him unsuccessfully, then he isn’t going to want to be with you at all. If you lie to him successfully, then that’s not an excellent way to build a relationship. Just be as honest as can be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, you’re interested in him. That’s nothing to be ashamed of. You should let him know of your interest in him. Ask him questions about his life. Let him feel like you want to get to know him on a more personal level. He has to feel like you’re slowly becoming invested in him if he’s going to do the same for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Try always to maintain open body language. When you’re standing in front of him, make sure that there isn’t anything between you. If you’re sitting across him, make sure that you’re not crossing your arms. Your body language can say a lot about how you feel about him. And what you want him to think is that you’re welcoming him into your life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You don’t want to make it too easy for him. Guys like the chase. But you don’t want to make it too hard either. You want to be able to strike that perfect balance.

He has to feel like he has to put forth the effort for you legitimately. But he also has to feel like he’s got a shot at winning your heart too. If he feels like you’re impossible, then he isn’t going to pursue you any longer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Always exude confidence. This is the only way to make him feel like you take yourself seriously. So, in turn, he’s going to end up having to take you seriously as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have self-esteem issues, just try to toughen up. Confidence is always going to be one of the most attractive things in a person. However, you have to know your limits too. You don’t want to come off as arrogant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scent branding and marketing is a real thing, and you should capitalize on that. When you walk into stores nowadays, they have these diffusers and aromas that trick their customers into feeling more comfortable with spending more money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s the same with perfumes. You can wear certain scents that can help make a guy more attracted to you. This is scientifically proven too!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Never be afraid of just starting the conversation. It’s always going to be a win-win situation. If you start a conversation with a guy and he doesn’t end up liking you, then he’s probably not a guy worth being with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, if you start a conversation with someone and he enjoys the forwardness, then that’s a definite win for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don’t give him everything all in one go. During your first conversation, don’t be so quick to reveal too many facts about yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are still going to want to maintain a certain air of mystery around you.  You should leave him wanting more by teasing him a bit. With this, he’ll have no choice but to ask for a second date with you. It’s all psychology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Never underestimate a man’s ego. Most men like to feel like they are essential. They are going to grasp at any opportunity to feel needed. So, if he has a chance to impress you, allow him to do so. Ask him for help with certain things. He is going to love any opportunity he can get to show you that he can get the job done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Social media is a total game-changer when it comes to flirting and relationships nowadays. It’s an excellent platform for you to be able to flirt with him even when you’re apart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don’t be afraid of sliding into his DM’s and making him feel like he’s a wanted man. It’s going to boost his ego and make him feel a lot more comfortable with you as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are very few things in the world that are more attractive than a woman who is talking about something that she is passionate about. So, whenever you get a chance to do so, talk about your passions when you are with him. He’s going to become infinitely more attracted to you when you do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, don’t be afraid of being forward and calling the shots. If he isn’t asking you out on a date, then you should be the one to ask him out. The worst-case scenario is that he says no. It would be his loss, and you can always move on to the next guy.
